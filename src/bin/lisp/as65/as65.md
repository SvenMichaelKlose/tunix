TUNIX Lisp 6502 assembler
=========================

Yes.  A construction site.

# Overview

This assembler processes source as regular Lisp expressions.
Accordingly, there is no line-oriented parsing.  Incoming symbols
are parsed to support hexadecimal and binary notation and to
reduce the required number of delimiting spaces:

~~~asm
    lda #$0a
    lda # 10  ; What the symbol parser makes of it.

    lda some_table,x
    lda some_table (quote x)  ; What READ makes of it.
~~~

Literal bytes and strings don't need red tape:

~~~asm
asciiz_welcome:
    "Hello world!" 0

ptr:
    0 0
~~~

Labels can be access like regular variables inside inlined Lisp
expressions.

~~~
    lda (++ ptr),y    ; Absolute Y
    lda ((++ ptr)),y  ; Indexed indirect Y
~~~

The assembler runs its own macro expansions.  Expanded macros are
always spliced in.

~~~asm
(macro mvwc (place const)
  $(lda #(low ,const)
    sta ,place
    lda #(high ,const)
    sta (++ ,place)))

    (mvwc $0200 $dead)
~~~

Label definitions have a colon following them:

~~~asm
label_definition1:
label_definition2 :
~~~

## Usage

| Variable        | Description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| \*as65-pc\*     | Current code output address (program counter)     |
| \*as65-labels\* | Label database.                                   |
| \*as65-macros\* | Associative list of macro functions.              |

### (as65 addr code)

AS65 assembles to memory.

~~~asm
; Assemble and run code at run-time.
(as65/read-labels "kernal.lbl")
(!= (malloc 256)
  (as65 !
    '(    lda #<txt
          ldy #>txt
          jmp MSGOUT
      txt:    "Hello world!" 0))
  (sys !)
  (mfree !))
~~~

### (as65/files bin-path addr pathnames): Assemble set of files

You should ensure that the global variables are intialised before using AS65.
\*as65-pc\* must contain the address where the code is going to be executed.
\*as65-labels\* should be set to NIL (if you don't intend to use an existing set,
e.g. for hardware definitions).

AS65 is a multi-pass assembler and each pass must be assembled with the same
input.  During the first pass, undefined labels enforce non-zeropage address modes.
More passes are performed until the size of the generated code does not change
any more.

AS65/FILES has been written with constrained environments in mind, with
just enough working memory for labels.  That's why the input files are read again
for every pass added.
