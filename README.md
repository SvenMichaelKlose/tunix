The TUNIX Project
=================

This project attempts to create an operating system for
minimalistic computers that is portable, self-hosting, and
multi-tasking, complete with a comprehensive set of
applications.

TUNIX Lisp is under heavy construction at the moment.

There are [quite a lot for the VIC-20](src/lib/) but this
portale and embedded database will make a difference:
