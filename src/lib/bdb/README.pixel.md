Bielefeld DB
============

This is a key/value database library and every Unixoid
operating system should have one.  In traditional Unices it is
the "Berkeley DB" but this one is a lot simpler and intended
to be used on tiny computers with no fancy memory management.

Features:

* Light-weight; written in ANSI-C.
* Embedded; for use in applications.
* Simple API.
* Records of variable lengths and any format.  Must contain
  their keys.
* Fast; using b-trees and LRU lists.
* Secondary storage to free main memory.
* Long-term storage

Operations:

* Add record
* Find record
* Map record
* Get next/previous record ordered
* Empty cache to storage

Limitations:

* IDs of mapped records are not validated (on storage level).
* Records cannot be removed from storage.  It continues
  growing.
* Maximum number of records and storage size is defined at
  compile-time.
* One index per database only.

Future enhancements:

* List-only cache without b-trees.
* ID validation for testing at least by adding ID databases.
* Using no keys at all.
